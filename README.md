AndAppennino
============

AndAppennino is intended to be a PostmanLib-RingsTwice proof of concept. It was created in order to scratch my own itch and to provide a better way to check the local resorts webcams. 

It includes: bitmap caching, fragment layouts (still to be polished), and async interaction using my own PostmanLib library.
